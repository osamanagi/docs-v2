# Hypersender SMS Webhooks

The Hypersender SMS API offers a webhook-based integration that delivers real-time, event-driven notifications. This allows developers to monitor their connected phones (sms app) or respond to specific events.

* **Monitor Message Status**: Provides real-time updates on the status of sent messages, such as when the message is queued to be sent or has been successfully delivered.

* **Receive Incoming Messages**: Get notified when a new message is received on the connected phone.

* **Monitor Connected Phone**: Receive periodic heartbeats from your connected phone to ensure the connection is active and act when the phone is offline.
