# Hypersender WhatsApp Webhooks

The Hypersender WhatsApp API offers a webhook-based integration that delivers real-time, event-driven notifications. This allows developers to monitor their connected WhatsApp instances or respond to specific events, ranging from message interactions to contact and media management.

* **Status Updates**: Provides updates on the connection status of the connected WhatsApp instance, indicating whether the connection is open, closed, or in the process of connecting. It also updates the presence of chats in real-time, offering information on activities such as typing or recording a voice message.

* **Chats**: Tracks interactions and status changes for chats. This includes the creation of new chats, updates to existing ones, and various chat-specific actions like archiving.

* **Contacts**: Observes changes to the contacts associated with the connected WhatsApp instance. Any addition, removal, or update to a contact triggers a notification through the designated route.

* **Messages**: Central to WhatsApp's core functionality, our API extensively supports message monitoring. This includes notifications for incoming messages, updates to message status, and messages sent through the API.
