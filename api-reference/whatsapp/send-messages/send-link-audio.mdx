This specialized endpoint will allow you to send voice as if you were recording directly in the WhatsApp application.

## You can send voice messages in two ways:

## Provide a URL for the voice audio.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/docs/whatsapp/img/send-voice-url.jpeg" alt="send-voice-url" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  Please note that the URL must be publicly accessible and not require any authentication or special headers to access the file.

## Send the voice audio it self as a file upload.
