## Send Text Message Safe

The Send Text Safe endpoint functions similarly to the standard send-text endpoint but with enhanced safety features designed specifically to protect your WhatsApp number from being blocked or flagged for suspicious activity.

<Warning>
  * WhatsApp has strict policies against automated messaging, and using the standard send-text endpoint too frequently can lead to your number being flagged or blocked.
  * This endpoint is designed to mimic human behavior more closely, making it less likely for WhatsApp to detect automated activity.
</Warning>

### **It:**

* Automatically calculates the appropriate delay between messages based on text length, by adding a few seconds for thinking/reviewing before sending
* Simulates typing behavior in WhatsApp before sending the message
* Significantly reduces the risk of your WhatsApp number being blocked due to automated messaging patterns
* Reduces the risk of being flagged for automated behavior

## Sending link preview

If the text has a link - it generates a preview for that link. You can adjust the behaviour by setting

* `link_preview: true` - to enable link preview
* `link_preview_high_quality: true` - to enable high-quality link preview

<Info>
  You can still send messages directly with `send-text` endpoint, but we highly recommend using this endpoint for regular messaging operations to maintain a more natural communication pattern, and keep your whatsapp number safe from being blocked.
