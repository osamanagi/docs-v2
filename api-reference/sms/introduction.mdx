Send and receive sms messages, with Hypersender SMS API. This Documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the API, including detailed information on how to send and receive sms messages, controll message threads, and monitor phone heartbeats.

## How it works

Hypersender SMS is just an API that allows you to send SMS messages using your android phone's SIM card. The API works by sending a message to your phone, and then your phone sends the message to the recipient. The API also allows you to receive messages, and monitor your phone's heartbeats.

<Warning>
  **Sender Name Limitation:**

  When sending SMS messages through the Hypersender API, the recipient will see the message as coming from your phone number rather than a custom sender name or business name. Custom sender names require extensive business verification processes and regulatory compliance that can take weeks or months to complete. Our API is designed to provide immediate SMS functionality using your existing phone number, offering a streamlined solution for your messaging needs. Please ensure your recipients are aware of this when setting up your messaging workflows.
</Warning>

## Receive Messages

To receive messages, you need to have the Hypersender app installed on your android phone. The app will receive the messages, and then send them to the specified webhook.

## Heartbeats

Heartbeats are like signles that used to monitor the status of your phone. your phone will send a heartbeat to the API every 15 minutes, to let the API know that it's still online.

If your phone doesn't send a heartbeat for more than 2 hours, the API will consider your phone as offline.

## Working with android app

To use the API, you need to have the Hypersender app installed on your android phone. The app will receive the messages and send them to the recipient.

### Why the app is not on the play store

Currently, the app is only available for android. Google Play Store currently doesn't allow SMS apps, so you can't download the app from the store.

<Info>
  We recommend using a secondary phone number, because the app will send and receive messages using your phone's SIM card.
</Info>

### Why android only

The app is only available for android because of the restrictions on iOS. Apple doesn't allow apps to send SMS messages, so we can't make an app for iOS.

## cost of sending messages

We don't charge you for sending messages, but for using the API. Please check the pricing page for more information.

Sending costs is different from one country to another, and directly depends on the carrier's pricing and offers.

## bulk sending

Currently, the API doesn't support bulk sending, but you can send multiple messages by sending multiple requests.

## international messaging

As long as you have an android phone and SIM card you can send messages from anywhere in the world but take into consideration that the carrier may charge you significantly more for international messaging.
