<Step title="Create an account">

To get started, you need to create an account on Hypersender. Visit [Hypersender](https://app.hypersender.com/login) and click on the Sign Up button.


</Step>

<Step title="Create an Instance">

After you have successfully created an account, you need to create an instance. An instance represents a one phone number and the app on your android phone. You can create multiple instances for different phone numbers.

1. Click on the **Create Instance** button.

2. Select Service Type: **WhatsApp**

3. Enter a name for your instance.

4. Enter your phone number. i.e. `+2011313311331`, make sure it's a working number and you have access to it.

5. Enter a description for your instance **(Optional)**.

</Step>

<Step title="Copy API Key">

After you have created an instance successfully, you will be redirected to the instance listing page. You'll immediately see a notification to copy your API key. Click on the **Copy** button to copy the API key to your clipboard.

Copy `instanceId` and `apiKey`, you will need them to authenticate your requests.

</Step>

<Step title="Download the Hypersender SMS App">

Currently, Google Play Store does not allow SMS apps to be published. So you need to download the app from the Hypersender website.

1. Visit the Github release page: [Hypersender SMS App](https://github.com/hypersender/sms-app-releases/releases).

2. Click on the Download App button.

3. Scan the QR code using your phone to download the app.

### Battery Optimization

Hypersender needs to work continuously in the background to send, receive, view, and manage messages, so it's important to disable battery optimization for the app.

Hypersender will asks you to disable battery optimization when you first open it. Click on the **Ignore Battery Optimization** button to disable battery optimization for the app.

</Frame>

<Warning>
If for some reason you missed the battery optimization prompt, you can disable battery optimization manually by following these steps:

1. Open **Settings** on your phone.

2. Search for **Battery Optimization**.

3. Search for **Hypersender SMS** and disable battery optimization for the app.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your SMS App">

You'll notice that connection status is **Disconnected**. To connect your SMS app, you need to enter the API key you copied earlier in the app.

</Step>

<Step title="Send your first message">

After you have successfully connected your SMS app, you should see the connection status as **Connected**. Now you can send your first message.
