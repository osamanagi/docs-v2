Heartbeat are basically a signal that your Android phone sends to Hypersender to let it know that it's still alive and connected to the internet. This is important because Hypersender needs to know if your phone is still connected to the internet to send and receive SMS messages.

## Automatic Heartbeats

Hypersender Android app sends a heartbeat signal to Hypersender every 15 minutes. This is done automatically in the background and you don't have to do anything.

<Note>
  Hypersender will consider your phone offline if it doesn't receive a heartbeat signal from your phone for more than 2 hours. In this case, Hypersender will stop sending SMS messages to your phone until it receives a heartbeat signal from your phone.
