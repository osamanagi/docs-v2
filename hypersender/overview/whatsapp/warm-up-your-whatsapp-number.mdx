title: "Warming Up New Phone Numbers for WhatsApp API"
description: ""
---

Recent changes in WhatsApp's security protocols have led to stricter monitoring of new numbers, frequently resulting in blocks. This presents a challenge for businesses integrating the WhatsApp API, particularly those using new eSIM numbers. To avoid these blocks, it's crucial to 'warm up' new numbers, mimicking human behavior to establish legitimacy.

The longer a number has been registered with WhatsApp, the more resistant it is to blocking.

Newly registered numbers are immediately flagged as "suspicious". Therefore:

<Warning>
**Important**: Do not scan the QR code immediately after registering a new number on WhatsApp. Wait a few hours or more!
</Warning>

## The Concept of **'Number Warming'**

'Number warming' in the WhatsApp context means gradually increasing a new number's activity. This process is vital to avoid triggering WhatsApp's anti-spam algorithms, which are quick to block numbers showing sudden, high-volume activity.

Warming involves typical user behaviors: messaging, calling, status updates, and group participation. It's a strategy to show the number is used naturally, not for spam or automation. Proper warming builds a usage history, reducing the risk of blocks when starting API integration.

## Strategies for Warming Up New Numbers

Successfully "warming up" a new number on WhatsApp involves a step-by-step approach over a period of about 3-10 days. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Important**: After connecting a new number, do not rush to immediately send messages through the API!

The following are "perfectly calibrated" tips for a new number just purchased. We realize that you don't always have time to do this. Therefore, we encourage you to use these tips as a basic framework, adjusting the rules to suit your situation.

<Steps>
<Step title="Day 1:">
* Do not connect your newly registered WhatsApp number to our service immediately. Wait a few hours.
* Complete setting up your profile on your phone (set details, profile picture).
* Ensure you have at least 20-50 contacts in your address book. If not, add some contacts (an empty address book is a risk factor!).
* Manually message 1-2 contacts you know from your phonebook and ensure you get a response.
</Step>

<Step title="Day 2:">
* Start a few private chats (3-6 conversations) with your existing contacts through your phone.
* Write a few varied messages via API and ensure you get responses. Send and receive a few images or videos/stickers to mimic typical user behavior.
</Step>

<Step title="Day 3:">
* Increase the number of conversations to 10-15 chats.
* Continue to write varied messages and media messages (about 1 message per minute). Ensure you get responses to your messages.
</Step>

<Step title="Day 4:">
* Begin to initiate more conversations, gradually increasing the number each day.
* Start participating in group conversations, if possible.
* Send a wider variety of messages, including links and longer texts.
* Strive to keep the number of sent messages equal to the number of incoming messages.
</Step>

<Step title="Day 5+: Diversifying Activities">
* Create or join more groups and actively participate in them.
* Start using WhatsApp status updates, use channels, and create a community.
* Continue to increase the volume of messages and diversify the types of messages sent.
* Initially, don't send more than 2 messages per minute, more than 6 hours a day, or more than 3 days in a row.
</Step>
</Steps>

## General Tips:

* Ensure that the activities mimic real human behavior â€“ random rather than systematic.
* Add the number to your contacts before you text them.
* Avoid sending too many messages in a short time or engaging in one-way communication.
* Spread interactions throughout the day, not clustered at specific times.
* Gradually build up the number of messages and types of interactions.
