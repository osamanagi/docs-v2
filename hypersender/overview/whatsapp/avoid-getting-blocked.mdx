Remember, WhatsApp enforces strict policies to prevent spam and abuse on their platform.

In this guide, we will discuss the rules and principles that reduce the likelihood of your WhatsApp account being blocked. We will outline the essentials briefly, with detailed information provided below.

## Essentials

### 1. **The age of the number**

<Note>
  **A phone number that has been active on WhatsApp for a longer period is less likely to be blocked.**
</Note>

Recently registered numbers are immediately flagged by WhatsApp as "suspicious" because spammers often use new numbers to send spam messages. Therefore, it is recommended to:

* **Warm up your number**: It is advisable to [warm up](#) your number by sending and receiving a few messages and files with real contacts before connecting it to the API.

<Warning>
  Avoid scanning the QR code immediately after registering a new number. Wait for a few days before starting to send messages.
</Warning>

### 2. **Spam Compliance**

Blocking often occurs due to users reporting spam messages. To avoid this, follow these guidelines:

- **Have recipients message you first**: Add a "Contact Us" button to your website or app, so users can message you first. Use a contact link generator to create a link that opens a chat with your number.

- **Strong Opening Message**: It's important to get the user to engage with your message and reply to it with at least one message. Ensure your first message is strong and engaging, clearly stating the purpose of the message.

- **Stop Command**: Always provide a way for users to stop receiving messages from you. This can be done by including a stop command in your messages, such as "Reply STOP to unsubscribe". This will help prevent users from reporting your number to WhatsApp to stop receiving messages.

- **Caring for Recipients**: Always make sure that your message is personal and appealing - for example, by using the recipient's name in the message (e.g., "Good morning, John Doe!").

<Warning>
  The first thing the recipient sees is a giant red "Block" button, so make sure your message is engaging to avoid tempting the recipient to click it.
</Warning>

### 3. **Response Rate**

> **Ratio of messages sent to messages received**

WhatsApp uses response rate as a metric to determine if a number is spamming. Ensure you respond to messages within 24 hours to maintain a good response rate.

The ideal scenario is when customers initiate contact and add you to their contacts. However, this is not always achievable, and you may need to start the conversation.

<Warning>
  If you send many messages without receiving replies, you risk getting banned.
</Warning>

To encourage responses, ask a question in your message or include a call to action that requires a reply.

<Check>
  Aim for a response rate of at least 30% per 100 messages sent.
</Check>

### 4. **Mass Messaging**[​](#4-mass-messaging "Direct link to 4-mass-messaging")

WhatsApp imposes a limit on the number of messages you can send per day. Exceeding this limit may result in your account being blocked.

To maintain user experience, WhatsApp is committed to blocking spam messages to prevent users from being harassed by unknown messages. If you send many messages to strangers, WhatsApp will remind the recipient to report the message and block the sender. If this behavior continues, your WhatsApp account may be permanently blocked.

### 5. **Other Considerations**[​](#5-other-considerations "Direct link to 5-other-considerations")

When developing a bot for WhatsApp, it's important to follow additional guidelines, such as avoiding the use of banned words and not sharing sensitive or inappropriate content. Be sure to read WhatsApp’s policies thoroughly to ensure your bot complies with all their rules.

## How to Avoid Getting Banned[​](#how-to-avoid-getting-banned "Direct link to How to Avoid Getting Banned")

WhatsApp recognizes that it’s uncommon for someone to send numerous or bulk messages to people they’ve never interacted with before, and such behavior is quickly flagged as spam or marketing junk. Here are some tips to follow before sending a message on WhatsApp:

### Guidelines[​](#guidelines "Direct link to Guidelines")

<Note>
  **Important**: Do NOT send messages that may get you reported. As long as you don’t receive reports from users you message, your account should remain in good standing.
</Note>

* **Provide real content**: A survey that the recipient has agreed to participate in is different from sending random content.

* **Vary your messages**: Create a script that randomly places spaces in your text and includes the recipient’s first name, making it appear as though a real person is typing.

* **Avoid fixed times**: Send the first message, wait a random amount of time between 30 and 60 seconds, and then send the second message.

* **Group contacts by area code**: WhatsApp expects a regular person to communicate mostly with contacts within the same area code as their phone number.

* **Profile information**: Having a profile picture, name, and status reduces the chances of being flagged as spam. Avoid sending messages from accounts without this information.

* **Opening message**: Start with a single short message. Avoid sending long texts or multiple messages without user consent. A strong opening message is crucial; if the user doesn’t reply, the chances of being reported increase.

* **Engage in conversations**: Encourage dialogue. If recipients don’t immediately block you and add you to their contact list, it strengthens your number against a ban.

<Warning>
  If your content is spam, it doesn’t matter if you use a broadcast list, group, or direct contact—you will still be banned.
</Warning>

As an API provider, we recommend adhering to WhatsApp’s policies, avoiding spam messages, and waiting for the other person to contact you first.
